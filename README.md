This chess app was created using Visual Studio 2013 and cinder_0.8.6_vc2013. To compile the code both are neccisary.

If using a newer version of Visual studio do not update the project past 2013 or there will be linker errors steming from old boost libraries that are present in cinder_0.8.6_vc2013.
